# Data Import/Export Fix Documentation

## Overview
Fixed critical bugs in the data import functionality that prevented imported data from being visible in the UI and improved the overall import experience.

## Problems Identified

1. **Wrong Data Structure**: `DataUpload` component was passing `{ message: string }` instead of actual import statistics
2. **Frontend-Backend Disconnect**: SettingsView expected risk/control data but the backend only returns statistics
3. **No Auto Refresh**: After successful import, the UI didn't refresh to show new data
4. **Broken localStorage Logic**: Code was saving to localStorage but never reading from it
5. **Poor Error Feedback**: Import errors weren't properly displayed to users
6. **No Transaction Support**: Failed imports could leave partial data

## Changes Made

### 1. DataUpload Component (`src/components/data/DataUpload.tsx`)
- Changed `onDataImport` prop to `onImportSuccess` with proper statistics interface
- Updated to pass actual import statistics from API response
- Enhanced UI to show:
  - Records found in file
  - Records successfully imported
  - Records skipped (already exist)
  - Import errors with details

### 2. SettingsView (`src/views/SettingsView.tsx`)
- Removed broken localStorage logic for imported data
- Updated `handleDataImport` to:
  - Accept import statistics instead of data
  - Refresh both risk and control stores after successful import
  - Show success message with import summary
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Upload API Endpoint (`server/api/v1/upload.cjs`)
- Added transaction support for atomic imports
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better duplicate handling (not treated as errors)
- Enhanced response with detailed statistics
- Added data validation before import

### 4. Service Initialization
- Updated to pass persistence provider to upload service
- Added `getPersistenceProvider` method to risks API
- Enables transaction support when available

## How It Works Now

1. User uploads Excel file in Settings
2. Backend parses the file and validates data
3. Import runs in a transaction (if supported)
4. Statistics are returned showing what was imported/skipped
5. Frontend refreshes stores to load new data
6. User sees success message and new data immediately

## Testing

### Test Data Generator
Created `scripts/create-test-import-file.cjs` to generate test Excel files with:
- 2 test risks with all required fields
- 2 test controls with compliance data

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Run backend: `npm run dev:server`
2. Run frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to Settings
4. Click "Upload Excel File"
5. Select `test-data/test-import-data.xlsx`
6. Verify import statistics are shown
7. Check that new data appears in Risks/Controls views

## Export Functionality
The export features (Excel, CSV, PDF) were already working correctly and required no fixes.

## Future Enhancements
- Add downloadable error report for failed imports
- Store import history with timestamps
- Support for updating existing records during import
- Bulk import progress indicator for large files

# Dashboard Visual Alignment Test Results

## Date: 2025-07-21
## Status: TESTING

## Test Environment
- Development server: http://localhost:3001
- Browser: Chrome (latest)
- Viewport: 1920x1080

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made:
1. **Matrix Cell Sizing**
   - Used `aspect-square` with relative/absolute positioning
   - Wrapped each cell in a container with `relative aspect-square`
   - Inner div uses `absolute inset-0` for perfect square sizing

2. **Grid Proportions**
   - Changed from `grid-cols-[2fr,3fr]` to `grid-cols-[5fr,7fr]`
   - Gives more space to the risk details table
   - Better balance between matrix and table sections

3. **Container Queries**
   - Added dynamic style injection for responsive text sizing
   - Matrix cell text adapts based on container width
   - Ensures readability at all viewport sizes

4. **Table Layout**
   - Added explicit column widths using `colgroup`
   - Improved space distribution for content visibility
   - Added padding to scroll container for better spacing

## Expected Improvements

### ✅ Matrix Cells
- Cells should appear perfectly square at all viewport sizes
- No stretching or distortion
- Consistent sizing across all cells

### ✅ Grid Gaps
- Clean 2px gaps between cells (gap-0.5)
- Consistent spacing throughout matrix
- No irregular white lines

### ✅ Table Content
- Risk descriptions fully visible
- Owner names not truncated unnecessarily
- Proper column width distribution

### ✅ Responsive Behavior
- Text sizes adapt to container width
- Layout remains functional on smaller screens
- No horizontal scrolling required

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Issues Identified):
1. Matrix cells stretched horizontally
2. Inconsistent gaps between cells
3. Table content cut off
4. Poor space distribution

### After (Expected):
1. Perfect square matrix cells
2. Consistent 2px gaps
3. Table content properly displayed
4. Optimized space distribution (5:7 ratio)

## Browser Testing Checklist

- [ ] Chrome: Test matrix cell squareness
- [ ] Firefox: Verify container queries work
- [ ] Safari: Check aspect-ratio support
- [ ] Edge: Confirm responsive behavior

## Performance Notes

- Container queries are modern CSS feature (good browser support)
- Aspect-ratio CSS property has excellent support
- No JavaScript required for layout (pure CSS solution)

## Next Steps

1. Visual verification in browser
2. Screenshot comparison with original issues
3. Test responsive behavior at different viewports
4. Verify no regressions in functionality

## Test Script

A test script is available at `test-dashboard-alignment.js` that can be run in the browser console to verify:
- Matrix cell dimensions
- Grid gaps
- Table truncation
- Container query implementation
- Responsive text sizing

# Dashboard Visual Test Checklist

## Test URL: http://localhost:3001

## Visual Tests to Perform

### 1. Risk Matrix Cells
- [ ] Open dashboard in browser
- [ ] Inspect risk matrix cells - they should be perfect squares
- [ ] Check that cells maintain square shape when browser is resized
- [ ] Verify no horizontal stretching of cells

### 2. Matrix Grid Gaps  
- [ ] Look for consistent small gaps between matrix cells
- [ ] Ensure no irregular white lines or spacing issues
- [ ] Verify heat map appearance is cohesive

### 3. Risk Details Table
- [ ] Check that risk descriptions are fully visible
- [ ] Verify owner names are not unnecessarily truncated
- [ ] Confirm column widths provide adequate space for content
- [ ] Scroll through table to ensure all content is readable

### 4. Layout Proportions
- [ ] Verify Risk Landscape section has adequate but not excessive width
- [ ] Check that the matrix and table sections are well-balanced (5:7 ratio)
- [ ] Ensure right column cards have sufficient space

### 5. Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Resize browser window to test different viewport sizes
- [ ] Check that matrix cell text scales appropriately
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scrolling is required at standard desktop sizes
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport to ensure graceful degradation

### 6. Interactive Elements
- [ ] Click on matrix cells - verify navigation works
- [ ] Hover over cells - check hover effects still function
- [ ] Click table rows - ensure navigation to risk details works
- [ ] Test all interactive bar charts in right column

## Browser Console Test

Run this in the browser console on the dashboard page:

```javascript
// Copy the contents of test-dashboard-alignment.js and paste into console
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Matrix cells square
- ✅ Grid gap: 2px  
- ✅ Table content truncation: 0 cells truncated (or minimal)
- ✅ Grid proportions updated
- ✅ Container queries implemented

## Screenshot Comparison

Compare with the original issues:
1. Before: Matrix cells stretched horizontally
2. After: Matrix cells should be perfect squares

3. Before: Table content cut off
4. After: Table content should be fully visible with proper column widths

## Performance Check

1. Open browser DevTools Performance tab
2. Record while interacting with dashboard
3. Check for:
   - Smooth hover transitions
   - No layout thrashing
   - Reasonable paint times

## Accessibility Check

1. Tab through the dashboard using keyboard only
2. Verify all interactive elements are reachable
3. Check that matrix cells have proper ARIA labels
4. Test with screen reader if available

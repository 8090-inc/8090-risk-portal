# Critical Frontend Fixes - Complete

## Summary
All critical issues blocking frontend functionality have been resolved.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. API Endpoint Version Mismatch ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/risks` and `/api/controls` but backend serves `/api/v1/risks` and `/api/v1/controls`

**Files Updated**:
- `src/store/riskStore.ts`: Updated 4 API endpoints
  - GET `/api/risks` → `/api/v1/risks`
  - POST `/api/risks` → `/api/v1/risks`
  - PUT `/api/risks/:id` → `/api/v1/risks/:id`
  - DELETE `/api/risks/:id` → `/api/v1/risks/:id`

- `src/store/controlStore.ts`: Updated 4 API endpoints
  - GET `/api/controls` → `/api/v1/controls`
  - POST `/api/controls` → `/api/v1/controls`
  - PUT `/api/controls/:id` → `/api/v1/controls/:id`
  - DELETE `/api/controls/:id` → `/api/v1/controls/:id`

**Result**: All CRUD operations now work correctly

### 2. Risk-Control Relationship Management ✅
**Already Fixed in Previous Session**:
- Added relationship management UI in RiskDetailView and ControlDetailView
- Added backend endpoints for updating relationships
- Users can edit relationships from detail views

**Note on SimpleRiskMatrixView**:
- The matrix view allows selecting controls only when creating new risks
- Editing control relationships for existing risks requires using the detail views
- This is acceptable as the functionality is available, just not in the matrix view

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
npm run build  # ✅ Successful
```

### Functional Testing
1. All API calls now use correct `/api/v1/` endpoints
2. Risk and Control CRUD operations work
3. Relationship management works via detail views
4. Reports use live data

## What Works Now
- ✅ Loading risks and controls
- ✅ Creating new risks and controls
- ✅ Updating risks and controls
- ✅ Deleting risks and controls
- ✅ Managing risk-control relationships (via detail views)
- ✅ Generating reports with live data
- ✅ All authentication flows

The frontend is now fully functional with the backend API.

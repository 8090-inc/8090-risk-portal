# Bug Report: Export Button Not Functional on Controls Dashboard

## Bug ID: BUG-002
## Date: 2025-07-20
## Status: FIXED
## Fixed: 2025-07-20

## Description
The Export button on the Controls dashboard does not perform any action when clicked. It only logs a message to the console instead of exporting the controls data.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Controls page (/controls)
2. Click the "Export" button
3. Observe that no file is downloaded
4. Check browser console to see "Export controls" logged

## Current Behavior
- Button clicks log "Export controls" to console
- No file is generated or downloaded
- User receives no feedback that export failed

## Expected Behavior
- Clicking Export should download an Excel file containing all controls data
- File should include all relevant control information
- Filename should include the current date
- If filters are active, only filtered controls should be exported

## Root Cause
The `handleExport` function in `ControlsView.tsx` is not implemented:

```typescript
const handleExport = () => {
  // TODO: Implement export functionality
  console.log('Export controls');
};
```

## Solution: Simple Excel Export

### Implementation Details

1. **Import the export utility**:
```typescript
import { exportControlsToExcel } from '../utils/exportUtils';
```

2. **Update the handleExport function**:
```typescript
const handleExport = () => {
  const filename = `controls-register-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.xlsx`;
  exportControlsToExcel(filteredControls, filename);
};
```

### Why This Solution
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- Consistent with existing export utilities
- Excel format is widely compatible
- Respects current filters (exports `filteredControls`)
- Includes date in filename for versioning

### Files to Modify
- `/src/views/ControlsView.tsx` - Add import and update handleExport function

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Export button downloads Excel file
- [ ] Filename includes current date (e.g., `controls-register-2025-07-20.xlsx`)
- [ ] Excel file opens correctly
- [ ] All control fields are included:
  - Control ID
  - Description
  - Category
  - Implementation Status
  - Effectiveness
  - Compliance fields
  - Related Risk IDs
  - Compliance Score
- [ ] Export respects active filters (only filtered controls exported)
- [ ] Export works with no filters (all controls exported)
- [ ] Large datasets export successfully
- [ ] Empty dataset exports empty file without errors

### Verification Steps
1. Click Export with no filters → Verify all controls in file
2. Apply category filter → Export → Verify only filtered controls in file
3. Apply multiple filters → Export → Verify correct filtered data
4. Clear all data → Export → Verify empty file generated

### Notes
- The `exportControlsToExcel` function already exists in `/src/utils/exportUtils.ts`
- No additional dependencies needed (xlsx is already installed)
- This maintains consistency with the Risks export functionality

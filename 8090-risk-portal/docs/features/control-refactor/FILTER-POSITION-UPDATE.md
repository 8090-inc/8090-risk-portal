# Controls View Filter Position Update

## Date: 2025-07-20
## Status: COMPLETED

## Change Summary

Updated the Controls view to match the Risk Register view's filter placement for consistency across the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Filter Button to Header Actions
- Previously: Filter button was in a separate action bar below the summary cards
- Now: Filter button is in the header section alongside the Export button
- This matches the Risk Register view layout

### 2. Reorganized Content Order
- **Before**: Header → Summary Cards → Action Buttons → Filter Panel → Table
- **After**: Header (with actions) → Filter Panel → Summary Cards → Table

### 3. Visual Consistency
- Both views now have the same header structure with actions on the right
- Filter panels appear in the same position (after header, before content)
- Consistent spacing and layout between views

## Benefits
1. **Consistency** - Same UI pattern across Risk Register and Controls views
2. **Better Flow** - Filters appear before the content they affect
3. **Cleaner Layout** - No separate action button bar
4. **Improved UX** - Users find controls in expected locations

## Technical Details
- File modified: `/src/views/ControlsView.tsx`
- No new dependencies or components needed
- TypeScript compilation verified

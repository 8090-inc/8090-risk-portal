**Environment**: Local Development  
**Tester**: Automated Script + Manual Verification

## 🧪 Automated Test Results

### Test Script Execution
Successfully executed `scripts/test-risk-edit.cjs` with the following results:

#### Test 1: RISK-ACCURACY
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passed
- **Performance**: 9.97 seconds total
- **Fields Updated**: 
  - Description, Initial/Residual Risk Levels
  - Ownership (2 owners), Controls (2 linked)
  - Risk reduction: 16 points (80%)
- **Data Restoration**: ✅ Original data successfully restored

#### Test 2: RISK-SENSITIVE-INFORMATION-LEAKAGE  
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passed
- **Performance**: 10.37 seconds total
- **Fields Updated**: Same as Test 1
- **Data Restoration**: ✅ Original data successfully restored

### API Verification
✅ GET `/api/v1/risks/:id` - Fetches risk details  
✅ PUT `/api/v1/risks/:id` - Updates risk successfully  
✅ Response times under 10 seconds (includes Excel sync)  
✅ All calculated fields (risk levels, reduction %) compute correctly

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Actual | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| API Update Time | ~5s | < 3s | ⚠️ Slightly above target |
| Total Test Time | ~10s | N/A | ✅ Acceptable |
| Excel Sync | Included | < 5s | ✅ Within limits |
| Data Restoration | ~5s | N/A | ✅ Working |

## ✅ Verified Functionality

### 1. **Risk Field Updates**
- ✅ Risk Description - Text updates persist
- ✅ Risk Category - Dropdown selection works
- ✅ Initial Likelihood/Impact - Sliders function correctly
- ✅ Residual Likelihood/Impact - Auto-calculation works
- ✅ Risk Level Categories - Correct thresholds applied
- ✅ Agreed Mitigation - Markdown text accepted
- ✅ Ownership/Support - Multi-select arrays handled
- ✅ Related Controls - Relationship updates work

### 2. **Calculations**
- ✅ Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact
- ✅ Risk Reduction = Initial - Residual
- ✅ Risk Reduction % = (Reduction / Initial) × 100
- ✅ Category thresholds: Low (1-5), Medium (6-10), High (12-15), Critical (16-25)

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- ✅ Updates persist to backend
- ✅ Google Drive Excel sync confirmed via API
- ✅ Data survives page refresh
- ✅ Relationships maintained correctly

### 4. **Error Handling**
- ✅ 404 errors for non-existent risks handled properly
- ✅ API error messages are descriptive
- ✅ Validation prevents invalid data submission

## 🐛 Issues Found

### Minor Issues
1. **Performance**: Update operations take ~5 seconds (slightly above 3s target)
   - Cause: Excel download/upload cycle
   - Impact: Minor UX delay
   - Severity: Low

2. **Response Headers**: X-Response-Time header not set
   - Impact: Cannot measure exact API timing
   - Severity: Very Low

### No Critical Issues Found ✅

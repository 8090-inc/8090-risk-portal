# Phase 4 UI Features - Completion Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary
All Phase 4 UI features have been successfully implemented in the Risk Matrix View (SimpleRiskMatrixView.tsx).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Add Risk Modal Enhancement ✅
- Added "Related Controls" MultiSelect field to the Add Risk Modal
- Users can now select multiple controls when creating a new risk
- Control options display as "CONTROL-ID - Description" for clarity
- Related control IDs are properly saved to the risk object

### 2. Add Control Feature ✅
- Added "+ Add Control" button next to the "Add Risk" button in the header
- Created comprehensive Add Control Modal with all required fields:
  - Control Category (dropdown)
  - Control ID (auto-generated based on category prefix)
  - Description (textarea)
  - Implementation Status (dropdown)
  - Effectiveness (dropdown)
  - Compliance mappings (6 input fields for different frameworks)
  - Related Risks (MultiSelect)
- Control ID generation logic:
  - ACC-XX for "Accuracy & Judgment"
  - SEC-XX for "Security & Data Privacy" 
  - LOG-XX for "Audit & Traceability"
  - GOV-XX for "Governance & Compliance"
  - Automatically increments to next available number

### 3. CSV Export Fix ✅
- Imported existing `exportRisksToCSV` utility from utils/exportUtils.ts
- Added onClick handler to Export CSV button
- CSV export includes all risk fields with proper formatting
- Handles special characters, commas, and newlines correctly

### 4. Title Update ✅
- Removed "(Simple View)" from the page header
- Title now simply reads "Risk Matrix"

## Technical Details

### Type Safety Improvements
- Created `EditedRiskFields` interface for tracking edited fields
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to partial risk updates
- Properly typed all control-related state and props

### Code Organization
- All changes contained within SimpleRiskMatrixView.tsx
- Imported necessary types and utilities
- Maintained consistency with existing patterns

### Integration Points
- Uses existing `useControlStore` for control operations
- Leverages `createControl` action from the store
- Integrates with backend POST /api/controls endpoint

## Next Steps
Phase 4 is complete. Remaining phases:
- Phase 6: Testing (partially complete)
- Phase 7: Production Deployment

## Files Modified

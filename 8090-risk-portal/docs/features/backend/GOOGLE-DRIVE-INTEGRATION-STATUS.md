# Google Drive Integration Status

## Current Status: âœ… FULLY WORKING

### Working Features âœ“
1. **Authentication**: Service account successfully authenticates with Google Drive API
2. **Read Operations**: 
   - GET /api/risks - Returns 6 risks from Excel file
   - GET /api/controls - Returns 13 controls from Excel file
   - POST /api/refresh-data - Successfully refreshes data from Google Drive
3. **Excel Parsing**: Correctly parses "Risk Map" and "Controls Mapping" sheets
4. **Caching**: 5-minute cache implemented to reduce API calls

### Not Working âœ—
1. **Write Operations**:
   - POST /api/risks - Cannot upload updated Excel file back to Google Drive
   - POST /api/controls - Cannot upload updated Excel file back to Google Drive
   - Error: "File not found: 1OzrkAUQTWY7VUNrX-_akCWIuU2ALR3sm" when trying to update

### Root Cause
The service account (290017403746-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com) has **Viewer** permission on the file, which allows reading but not writing. To enable write operations, the service account needs **Editor** permission.

### Solution Required
Since the file is in a **Shared Team Drive**, the service account needs special permissions:

#### Option 1: Add Service Account to Shared Drive (Recommended)
1. Open the shared drive containing the file
2. Click the settings gear icon â†’ "Manage members"
3. Add the service account: 290017403746-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
4. Set role to "Content Manager" (allows read/write)
5. Click "Done"

#### Option 2: Grant File-Specific Editor Permission
1. Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OzrkAUQTWY7VUNrX-_akCWIuU2ALR3sm
2. Click the "Share" button
3. Ensure the service account has "Editor" permission
4. For shared drives, you may need to be a Manager to grant this

**Note**: The error "The user has not granted the app 290017403746 write access" indicates the service account has read-only access currently.

### Test Results

### Technical Implementation
- Server uses `googleapis` package for Drive API access

- Excel parsing with `xlsx` package
- CommonJS modules (.cjs) for Node.js compatibility
- Proper error handling and logging implemented

# Google Drive File Access Fix - Todo List

## Overview
This todo list tracks the necessary steps to fix the Google Drive file access issue in the 8090 Risk Portal application.

## Todo Items

### 1. Verify file access and permissions
- [ ] Check service account permissions on the target Google Drive file
- [ ] Verify the file ID is correct
- [ ] Ensure the service account has been granted appropriate access (Editor or Viewer)
- [ ] Test direct API access using Google's API Explorer
- [ ] Validate authentication credentials and token generation

### 2. Update Google Drive service implementation with better error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling in `/api/google-drive/download` endpoint
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Add detailed error logging with context
- [ ] Handle specific Google API error codes (403, 404, 401)
- [ ] Create custom error messages for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Add request/response logging for debugging

### 3. Add debugging endpoints and tools
- [ ] Create `/api/google-drive/test-auth` endpoint to verify authentication
- [ ] Add `/api/google-drive/list-files` endpoint to check file accessibility
- [ ] Implement `/api/google-drive/file-metadata/:fileId` to inspect file details
- [ ] Add logging middleware to track API requests
- [ ] Create a debug mode flag for verbose logging
- [ ] Add health check endpoint for Google Drive service

### 4. Test the complete implementation
- [ ] Unit tests for Google Drive service methods
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid file ID, no permissions, network failures)
- [ ] Verify file download functionality
- [ ] Test with different file types and sizes
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent requests
- [ ] End-to-end testing from frontend to backend

### 5. Document the solution
- [ ] Document the service account setup process
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document API endpoints and their usage
- [ ] Add code comments explaining the implementation
- [ ] Create deployment guide with environment variables
- [ ] Document security considerations and best practices
- [ ] Update README with Google Drive integration section

## Implementation Priority
1. First priority: Verify permissions and access (blocking issue)
2. Second priority: Update service with error handling (improves reliability)
3. Third priority: Add debugging tools (helps diagnose issues)
4. Fourth priority: Comprehensive testing (ensures stability)
5. Fifth priority: Documentation (maintains knowledge)

## Notes
- Each completed item should be checked off
- Add any discovered issues or blockers as sub-items
- Update this list as new requirements emerge

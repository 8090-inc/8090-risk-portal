# Scrollbar Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-24

### Problem
Horizontal scrollbars appeared on both Controls and Risks views at all viewport sizes, with vertical scrollbars showing before content required them.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by improper overflow handling in the layout hierarchy:
1. AppLayout didn't constrain overflow on the root container
2. View containers used `overflow-y-auto` which allows horizontal overflow
3. ControlsTable used `overflow-hidden` preventing table-level horizontal scroll

### Changes Made

#### 1. AppLayout.tsx
- Added `overflow-hidden` to root flex container (line 12)
- Changed main element from `overflow-y-auto` to `overflow-hidden` (line 24)
- Added `overflow-auto` to the inner content wrapper

#### 2. RisksView.tsx
- Changed container from simple `h-full` to `h-full flex flex-col overflow-hidden`
- Updated scrollable area to use `flex-1 overflow-auto min-w-0`

#### 3. ControlsView.tsx
- Applied same container structure as RisksView
- Ensures proper flex containment with `min-w-0`

#### 4. ControlsTable.tsx
- Changed from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-x-auto` (line 147)
- Enables horizontal scrolling for wide tables

#### 5. RiskMatrixView.tsx
- Updated container structure to match other views
- Proper overflow containment for AG-Grid

### Result
- No horizontal scrollbars at page level
- Tables only show horizontal scroll when content exceeds viewport
- Proper containment at all viewport sizes
- Responsive behavior maintained

### Testing Notes
- Verify at different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Check table behavior with many columns
- Ensure filters and other UI elements remain accessible
- Test AG-Grid behavior in Risk Matrix view

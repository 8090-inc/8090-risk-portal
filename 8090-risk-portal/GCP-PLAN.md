# GCP Deployment Plan for Risk Portal

## Progress Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Database Solution** 
   - ✅ Switched from Cloud SQL to Firestore (organization policy restriction)
   - ✅ Created Firestore database integration (`server/db/firestore.js`)
   - ✅ Initialized Firestore with admin and test users
   - ✅ Verified authentication working with Firestore

2. **TypeScript Fixes**
   - ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
   - ✅ Updated test files with correct types
   - ✅ Ensured build passes without errors

3. **Docker Images**
   - ✅ Created Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
   - ✅ Built images for linux/amd64 architecture
   - ✅ Pushed images to Artifact Registry

4. **Backend Deployment**
   - ✅ Created simplified backend to avoid routing issues
   - ✅ Deployed backend to Cloud Run (risk-portal-backend)
   - ✅ Backend accessible at: https://risk-portal-backend-290017403746.us-central1.run.app
   - ✅ Authentication endpoints working with real data

5. **IAM Configuration**
   - ✅ Created service accounts
   - ✅ Granted necessary permissions for Firestore access
   - ✅ Note: Public access blocked by organization policy (requires authentication)

### 🔄 In Progress

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Need to rebuild frontend for correct architecture
   - Update frontend to use authenticated backend URL

### ❌ Pending Tasks

1. **Custom Domain Configuration**
2. **API Gateway Setup** (for public access if needed)
3. **Secrets Management** (move JWT secret to Secret Manager)
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** 
5. **Monitoring & Logging Setup**
6. **Load Testing**
7. **Documentation Updates**

    # 8090 Risk Portal API Documentation
    
    ## Overview
    The 8090 Risk Portal API provides comprehensive management of AI-related risks and their mitigation controls. This API is designed for organizations implementing AI governance frameworks to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with AI systems.
    
    ## Core Concepts
    
    ### Risks
    A **Risk** represents a potential negative outcome from AI system deployment. Each risk is:
    - Categorized by type (e.g., Security, Accuracy, Behavioral)
    - Scored based on likelihood (1-5) and impact (1-5)
    - Tracked through initial and residual (post-mitigation) states
    - Linked to one or more mitigation controls
    
    ### Controls
    A **Control** represents a mitigation measure to reduce risk. Each control:
    - Has a unique ID following pattern: `{CATEGORY}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., ACC-01, SEC-02)
    - Describes specific actions to reduce risk
    - Tracks implementation status and effectiveness
    - Can mitigate multiple risks
    
    ### Risk-Control Relationships
    - Many-to-many relationships between risks and controls
    - Controls reduce risk scores from initial to residual levels
    - Orphaned entities (risks without controls) are tracked
    - Relationships stored in a dedicated sheet for audit trail
    
    ## ID Formats
    
    ### Risk IDs
    - **Format**: `RISK-{SANITIZED-NAME}`
    - **Generation**: Automatically generated from risk name
    - **Example**: "Sensitive Information Leakage" → `RISK-SENSITIVE-INFORMATION-LEAKAGE`
    - **Rules**: 
      - Uppercase only
      - Special characters removed
      - Spaces replaced with hyphens
      - Must be unique across system
    
    ### Control IDs
    - **Format**: `{CATEGORY}-{NUMBER}`
    - **Categories**:
      - `ACC` - Accuracy & Judgment controls
      - `SEC` - Security controls
      - `LOG` - Logging & Monitoring controls
      - `GOV` - Governance controls
      - `TEST` - Test controls (development only)
    - **Example**: `ACC-01`, `SEC-02`, `LOG-03`
    - **Rules**: 
      - Two-digit numbers (01-99)
      - Must follow exact pattern
      - Manually assigned by users
    
    ## Authentication
    
    The API uses Google Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for authentication:
    
    1. **Production**: Requests must include valid IAP JWT assertion
    2. **Development**: Test mode available with `x-test-user` header
    3. **Admin Access**: Users with `@dompe.com` email have admin privileges
    4. **Required Headers**:
       - `x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion`: IAP JWT token
       - `x-goog-authenticated-user-email`: User email (set by IAP)
    
    ## Request/Response Format
    
    ### Standard Response Structure
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "data": { /* resource data */ },
      "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "limit": 20,
        "total": 33,
        "totalPages": 2,
        "timestamp": "2025-07-22T10:00:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Error Response Structure
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "error": {
        "code": "RISK_NOT_FOUND",
        "message": "Risk with ID 'RISK-EXAMPLE' not found",
        "details": { "resourceId": "RISK-EXAMPLE" },
        "suggestion": "Verify the risk ID exists. List all risks: GET /api/v1/risks"
      },
      "meta": {
        "requestId": "req_abc123",
        "timestamp": "2025-07-22T10:00:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Query Parameters
    
    ### Filtering
    - Use query parameters to filter results
    - Multiple filters are combined with AND logic
    - Example: `?category=Security&minScore=15&hasControls=true`
    
    ### Sorting
    - Use `sort` parameter with field name
    - Prefix with `-` for descending order
    - Example: `?sort=-residualRiskLevel` (highest risk first)
    
    ### Pagination
    - Use `page` and `limit` parameters
    - Default: `page=1`, `limit=20`
    - Maximum limit: 100 items per page
    - Example: `?page=2&limit=50`
    
    ### Field Selection
    - Use `fields` parameter to limit returned fields
    - Comma-separated field names
    - Example: `?fields=id,risk,riskCategory,residualScoring`
    
    ## Rate Limiting
    
    - **Default**: 100 requests per minute per user
    - **Bulk Operations**: 10 requests per minute
    - **Headers**: Rate limit info returned in response headers
      - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit
      - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
      - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Reset timestamp
    
    ## Data Persistence
    
    - Currently uses Google Drive with Excel file storage
    - 5-minute cache for performance optimization
    - Transactions ensure data consistency during updates
    - Separate "Relationships" sheet maintains risk-control mappings
    - Future migration path to database prepared through abstraction layer

      summary: Find unmitigated risks
      description: |
        Retrieve risks that have no associated controls, indicating they are completely unmitigated.
        
        **Why this matters:**
        - Unmitigated risks represent full exposure
        - May indicate gaps in risk management
        - Priority candidates for control assignment
        - Required for compliance reporting
        
        **Use cases:**
        - Risk assessment completeness checks
        - Control gap analysis
        - Audit preparation
        - Risk owner notifications
        
        **Note:** Results include full risk details to facilitate immediate action

      summary: Add multiple controls to a risk in one operation
      description: |
        Efficiently add multiple controls to a risk in a single API call.
        
        **Advantages:**
        - Single transaction for consistency
        - Better performance than individual adds
        - Atomic operation (all or nothing)
        
        **Behavior:**
        - Existing relationships are preserved
        - Duplicates are ignored
        - Invalid IDs cause entire operation to fail

      summary: Create a new control
      description: |
        Create a new control in the system. Unlike risks, control IDs must be manually specified following the pattern.
        
        **ID Format Requirements:**
        - Pattern: `{CATEGORY}-{NUMBER}`
        - Categories: ACC, SEC, LOG, GOV, TEST
        - Numbers: 01-99 (two digits required)
        - Example: `SEC-03`, `ACC-12`
        
        **Required fields:**
        - `mitigationID`: Must follow the pattern
        - `mitigationDescription`: Clear description of the control
        
        **Best practices:**
        - Use sequential numbering within categories
        - Provide detailed implementation instructions
        - Set realistic effectiveness expectations
        - Assign clear ownership
